Get the entire dataset in bridge_data and the add column names to each data column and then read table in bridge_tbl  and then find the summary of the new table and few data from the table.
Then to manupulate or work with a smaller dataset we can slice the dataset into subset and work on it as bridge_sub

```{r}
bridge_data <- url("https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/bridges/bridges.data.version1","r")
colNames<-c("IDENTIF","RIVER","LOCATION","ERECTED","PURPOSE","LENGTH","LANES","CLEAR-G","T-OR-D","MATERIAL","SPAN","REL-L","TYPE")
bridge_tbl<-read.table(bridge_data,sep=",",dec=".",col.names=colNames,na.strings=c("NA", "-", "?"," "),stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
summary(bridge_tbl)
head(bridge_tbl)
bridge_sub<-bridge_tbl[,c(1,3,5,7,9,11)]
summary(bridge_sub)
head(bridge_sub)
close(bridge_data)

```
